    "#### (a) Lexical ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** ***\"You will see lots of plants in the south of the city.\"*** </p>\n",
    "**Explanation:** The word \"plant\" could mean either greenery including trees, flowers and herbs, or it could mean industrial facilities such as power plants. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### (b) Syntactic ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** ***\"She stared at a girl in a blue dress\"*** </p>\n",
    "**Explanation:** \"She\" could be staring a girl who wears a blue dress, or she could be in a blue dress while staring at a girl.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (c) Semantic ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** ***\"I took off Joe's jacket.\"*** </p>\n",

    "_An unbiased estimate of the generalized error rate for a decision tree with max depth 5, trained on T , is 0.35._ </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** </p>\n",
    "False. Let the solution to this training set $T$ be $f^A_T$. In this case, both the training set and the validation set $V$ are i.i.d. samples of all the data $U$. However, since there are limitless possible solutions to find a decision tree with max depth 5, $ f^A_T \\neq f^* $. So 0.35 is not an unbiased estimate of the generalized error rate for a decision tree with max depth 5, trained on T.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Statement 2:\n",
    "_An unbiased estimate of the generalized error rate for a tuned decision tree, trained on T , is 0.35._ </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** </p>\n",
    "True. By definition given from the question, a ***tuned decision tree*** is a decision tree chosen from the three decision trees trained on $T$ for which the validation error rate is minimum. Since we specified the training set $T$, the number of optimal models with each depth is fixed. And because our validation set $V$ is i.i.d. sample of $U$ ( assume it has a size of $m$), the expected value of average test error can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ E[avg test error] = {1 \\over m} \\sum_{(x_i, y_i) \\in S} E[error(x_i, y_i, f^A_T)] $\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $ E[avg test error] $ doesn't rely on $i$, which means that it is an unbiased estimate of the deneralization error rate for a ***tuned decision tree***.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Statement 3:\n",
    "_An unbiased estimate of the generalized error rate of the random decision tree is 0.35._ </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "False. Generalization error rate refers to the expected value of the misclassification error over **all** possible examples for the task. Since we defined random decision tree trained on $T$ to be either one model from all 3 possible models, the generalization error rate should be calculated across 3 different models."
